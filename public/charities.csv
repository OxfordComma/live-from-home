20200318,Aurora Commons,https://www.auroracommons.org/,https://www.auroracommons.org/covid19communityfund,"At this point, there are no shelters available in North Seattle near The AC and only a few number of beds in neighboring hotels. The AC currently is pushing the city to allow for organized homeless encampments so that housed people don’t become afraid of folks setting up camp on their front lawns. So here’s what I’d like to ask of you If you are in the Seattle area OR have access to an open and safe post office/shipping location, please drop off or send any and all tents/sleeping bags (used is fine) to the following address: The Aurora Commons c/o Lisa Etter-Carson 927 N 89th St Seattle, WA 98013. If you do drop off, please knock, leave your donations on the front porch, and walk away to maintain appreciate social distancing."
